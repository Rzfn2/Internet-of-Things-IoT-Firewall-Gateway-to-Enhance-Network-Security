Introduction

The IoT Firewall Gateway system integrates essential parts to create a solid, functional, and effective security solution. This system possesses numerous aspects and components that can be comprehensively analyzed and discussed over.

System Functionality

The system's main functionality is its ability to configure and manage firewall rules. Administrators have the ability to establish network zones, make modifications to rules, and set up automatic rule enforcement on a timetable. This feature guarantees strong network security by managing traffic and blocking unauthorized access. The system's firewall setup features are enhanced by regular security audits that verify the effectiveness of the firewall rules, ensuring that the network remains secure and follows the requirements of the industry.

Additionally, the system provides VPN settings for enabling secure remote access. Administrators can establish different VPN protocols, adjust server configurations, and monitor client access. This functionality ensures a secure connection to the network, protecting the data as it travels through encrypted routes. The VPN setup is closely connected with user authentication procedures, ensuring that only authorized users can access the network through the VPN.

Furthermore, the management of user authentication is an essential and crucial aspect of the system. This functionality enables administrators to establish and monitor user accounts, assign roles and permissions, and set authentication mechanisms. The system ensures that access to network resources is monitored and controlled by reorganizing user administration, therefore lowering the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.

Data Recovery and Secure Internet Utilization

The system includes a comprehensive data recovery functionality. System configurations and data are regularly backed up in order to ensure the integrity and accessibility of the data. If there is a security breach or system failure, the recovery capability enables administrators to revert configurations and data to a previous state, reducing downtime and safeguarding important information.

Moreover, the system facilitates secure internet utilization for both administrators and end-users. The system provides a secure browsing experience by utilizing established firewall rules and VPN settings to monitor and regulate all network traffic. The system records user activities to facilitate audits, thereby enhancing accountability and transparency.

Security Mechanisms

The IoT Firewall Gateway solution incorporates multiple security mechanisms to ensure data integrity and protect against potential threats. Regular security audits, along with careful monitoring and logging, assist in rapidly discovering and fixing issues. The system's security has been improved by the addition of data recovery and strong authentication procedures, which ensure that it can effectively prevent and respond to security problems.

Interface Design (UI)

Starting this section, OpenWRT is provided with a pre-configured, web-based interface called LuCI. The researcher will use this web interface once they have installed the required LuCI packages, taking advantage of its capabilities to administer and configure the IoT firewall. LuCI provides a user-friendly interface to engage with the OpenWRT system, allowing access to a range of settings pages and critical functionality for this research. Following successfully installing LuCI, the researcher proceeded to explore many essential components of the interface, such as the Network Page, wireless Page, firewall Page, system management, VPN Page, audit Page, and management pages. These features enabled the effective setup and administration of the IoT firewall, ensuring a network environment that is both safe and dependable. This interface not only simplified the setup process but also offered multiple choices to manage network administration and security.
